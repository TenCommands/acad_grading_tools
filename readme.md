# AutoCAD Grading Tools
### AutoCAD AutoLisp App
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in no way affiliated or supported by AutoCAD® or Autodesk.
> This is being made by a high school student[^1] for the purposes of assisting in the grading process of the intro drafting class.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is my first experience with the Lisp language. Expect possibly inefficient or buggy code. This language is weird and parentheses heavy as seen below.
> ```javascript
> // Javascript code
> x = 1 + 2 * 3 // results in x = 7
> ```
> ```lisp
> ; Lisp code
> (setq x (+ 1 (* 2 3))) ; sets x to 7
> ```
